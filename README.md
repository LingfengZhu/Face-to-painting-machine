# Face-to-painting-machine
This project is to identify human face and produce portrait paintings based on the photo. This repo contains the codes, report and PPT for the project 'Face to painting machine' written by myself, Zhuoyan Xu and Cecily Liu for Prof.Sebastian Raschka's Deep Learning course at UW-Madison. All code has been written for and tested in Python 3.6.

## Dataset
The Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset we use in face recognition part can be downloaded from: http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/

## Face recognition
Part of codes we use in the face recognition section (ResNet 34 for example) can be seen in the script:
> $ train_res34.ipynb

## Neural Style Transfer
Part of codes we use in the neural style transfer section can be seen in the script:
> $ Style.ipynb
